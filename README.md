# 75-days-of-python
My 75-day Python coding challenge. The idea of this challenge came up after watching some reels on Instagram, where people using stickers and write numbers from 1 to 75 are setting goal to lose weight. Each day they remove sticker with day number for example after completing exercises. And the results were incredible. So, I take this idea to build new skill is coding in Python. 

Start day: June 3, 2025
<br>
End day: August 17, 2025

**Goal:** Learn Python fundamentals, build projects and solve problems.

**Approach**
* Days 1–30: Python Fundamentals (Syntax, Data Structures, Functions, OOP) 
* Days 31–50: Mini-Projects & Libraries (Automation, Web Scraping, APIs) 
* Days 51–75: Advanced Topics + Portfolio Projects 

After every five days of learning and practice, consolidate your knowledge by focusing on applying what you've already learned. 

## Progress  
Day 1-5: Input → Data Types → Variables → Lists/Dicts → APIs 
Day 6 Recap Session
