# 75-days-of-python
My 75-day Python coding challenge. The idea of this challenge came up after watching some reels on Instagram, where people using stickers and write numbers from 1 to 75 are setting goal to lose weight. Each day they remove sticker with day number for example after completing exercises. And the results were incredible. So, I take this idea to build new skill is coding in Python.
